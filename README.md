# End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive guide to building a full-fledged data platform using Azure's suite of data engineering tools. The platform is designed to cover the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion and transformation to loading and reporting. This project demonstrates how to design and implement a scalable and secure data pipeline that addresses real-world business needs, particularly in environments where data must be ingested from on-premises sources and transformed for business intelligence and analytics.

## Tools and Technologies

The project leverages the following Azure services:

1. **Azure Data Factory**:
    - A cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation.
    - Used for orchestrating the data ingestion process from an on-premises SQL Server database into Azure.

2. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**:
    - Combines the capabilities of a hierarchical file system with the scalability and security features of Azure Blob Storage.
    - Serves as the landing zone for raw ingested data, providing scalable and secure storage.

3. **Azure Databricks**:
    - An Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform.
    - Used for transforming raw data into a clean, structured format, ready for analysis and reporting.

4. **Azure Synapse Analytics**:
    - An integrated analytics service that accelerates time-to-insight across data warehouses and big data systems.
    - Acts as the data warehouse where transformed, clean data is stored and made available for business intelligence and reporting.

5. **Azure Key Vault**:
    - A cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates.
    - Used to securely manage and control access to sensitive information such as connection strings and passwords.

6. **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**:
    - A cloud-based identity and access management service.
    - Provides authentication and access control for Azure services, ensuring secure and compliant operations.

7. **Microsoft Power BI**:
    - A business analytics tool that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities.
    - Connects to Azure Synapse Analytics to create interactive dashboards and reports for end-users.
